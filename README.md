## Ethical Considerations

Our lyric generation model has several use cases. For starters, it could be used for
inspiration for up and coming song-writers. It could also be used for people that love music
and are looking for a fun and entertaining way to generate songs. However, our model has
some limitations and could be misused. For instance, people could use it to generate offensive
(slurs, racist, discriminatory comments) lyrics if they were to manipulate the training data. If
someone were to license songs written with the help of our model they could face plagiarism
and copyrights issues if the lyrics were to be very similar to already existing songs. Finally,
since the model might not be 100% perfect, thus, our model might spit out ungrammatical or
meaningless lyrics occasionally.
